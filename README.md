TO INSTALL: Drop the draw-steel-monster-json-importer folder into your modules folder before launching FoundryVTT.  After launching the software, in should appear under the "Add-on modules" tab.  Launch your draw-steel world.  Then, activate the module under "Game Settings" and "Manage Modules".



When you go to the "Create Actor" tab, there should be an "Import Monster" button at the bottom of the panel.  Click it and follow the instructions.  You must use the .json files from the Steel Compendium here https://steelcompendium.io/#bestiary.



Please note that there is a possibility of the Steel Compendium data structure changing.  This is working as of Sept. 14th, 2025



To import Malice Features, copy and paste the Malice stat block, including the header, from the pdf into the text block under the "choose file" button.  The header is used to make sure only creatures with the same keyword (ex. Goblin) get the abilities and not other creatures that might be in the folder with them (ex. War Spider).



NOTE: To improve formatting of paragraphs in the Malice Features, you can edit the pasted text to get rid of unwanted line breaks.  You can see these by changing the size of the UI window and look for lines that don't dynamically change size when they should.
